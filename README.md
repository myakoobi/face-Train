this is a working code and a project which takes two photo and compares them to see if they are the same person.

it uses mostly libraries that are already pre-trained. 

*****************************************
It uses the face_net library which was initially developped by google and the library is a part of Deepface and one it's models. It has a lot of mistakes and bugs. However it saves a lot of time than making your own model and training it.
